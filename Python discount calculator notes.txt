Explanation:
Function Definition:

calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) takes in the original price and discount percentage.

If the discount is 20% or more, it calculates the new price using:

\text{final price} = \text{price} - (\text{price} \times \frac{\text{discount_percent}}{100})
Otherwise, it returns the original price.

User Input:

The program asks for the original price and discount percentage and converts them into float for decimal handling.

Applying the Function:

Calls calculate_discount() and stores the result.

Displaying Output:

If a discount is applied, it prints the final price.

If not, it tells the user that no discount was applied.
